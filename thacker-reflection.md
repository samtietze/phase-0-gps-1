1.) Prior to the GPS, I felt comfortable with most basic aspects of Git/Github. I still am somewhat unsure about how to best compose commit messages, and how the commit messages composed on my local machine correspond to those on Github. Also I had no experience with sharing a repository with another user.

2.) The GPS helped me to walk through the process of creating a new repository and working with a 'collaborator.'

3.) I asked my partner Sam about his advice on composing commit messages and also how best to use keyboard shortcuts on the command line both with Git and general file management (mv, cp, etc.). We didn't encounter too much difficulty, so the guide mostly allowed us to work on our own; I do remember that he solved for me the mystery of exiting from man pages.

4.) I am still uncertain of how solving merge conflicts on my local machine relates to merge conflicts on Github. (We encountered this issue after solving the merge conflict between the master and minor-conflict branches. Ultimately we just did 'git push origin master' to push the solved conflict to Github, but I'm not sure that was correct.)

5.) I found my first GPS experience to be very positive. My partner and I seemed to have a similar knowledge/experience level, and it was useful to work through the challenges together and smoothe out the rough edges where we were confused. Of my three pair sessions, I found this one to be the most engaging, and I look forward to pairing with Sam again in the future.
