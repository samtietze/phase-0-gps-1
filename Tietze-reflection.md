# Guided Pair Session Reflection
*Sam Tietze*

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  Prior to this GPS I had the fortune of working with Marla on Paired Challenge 2.2, and it was during this time that I got a chance to really sort through any Git issues I had. The thing that caught me the most was local vs remote branches. When I pulled my remote repo down, I expected my local branches to be updated to reflect the remote list. I still don't think I figured out a useful way of mass-updating my local branches based on the remote branches. I'll live!

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  It was nice to finally work in a pair on the same repo in a nearly simultaneous scenario. I also got a chance to see `git fetch origin <branch>` then `git merge <branch>` as opposed to a quick automated `git pull`. I think I prefer `git pull`, but it is useful to have options!

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  Our guide was super helpful for keeping us on track rather than worrying about some of the smaller questions we had. We wanted to see what the `--help` manual pages would show, but we couldn't figure out how to exit until he gave us a quick tip. He was also very helpful in helping us link local images inline since we were getting hung up on trying to do it a different way.
  Clint was my pair for this project, and I was very glad because he had a good recollection of the Markdown language. I spent the last few days working on HTML, so I had forgotten quite a bit of Markdown.

* What still confuses you about Git?
  I don't know that I'm confused about it so much, but I haven't had any experience with reverting a project to a particular commit. I really look forward to playing around with this sort of thing in the future.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  Excellent! I really like the way our guide let us do our thing before offering any kind of advice. Clint and I worked well together, and I really appreciated the feedback I got regarding navigating pace. I've been finding that I have a lot of fun navigating, so this is going to be great for learning.
